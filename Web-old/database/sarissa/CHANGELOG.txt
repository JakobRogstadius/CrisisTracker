Projects used when developing Sarissa:
    * Apache Maven and Ant are used to build the Sarissa distributions, 
      documentation and website. Sarissa can nowdays be used as a Maven dependency 
      in your Maven-based webapps, check out the documentation.
    * The Maven JSTools Plugin is used to produce documentation based on JSLint and 
      JSDoc Toolkit. The JSTools Plugin is also used in Maven based java webapps at  
      runtime, to resolve Sarissa or other JS files and resources.
    * ECMAUnit is used for Unit Testing. Check out the Sarissa Unit Tests page here.
    * The MobilVox Maven JavaScript Plugin is used to create the compressed versions 
      of the Sarissa JS files.
    * The Syntaxhighlighter is used for (obviously) syntax highlighting through out 
      the documentation.


Sarissa was inspired by articles and code available on the web, most notably the 
IE Emu Series [http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/ieemu/] and Cross-Browser DOM Wrapper 
[http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/domwrapper/] by Nicholas C. Zakas
 
################################################################################################

0.9.9.5
    * AllowXsltScript is false by default in MSXML 6, causing an error when an XSLT 
      file includes <msxsl:script> element(s). Thanks to Glen Di Persio, Web Developer
      and Systems Engineer extraordinaire ;-)
    * Fixed Opera bug in  Sarissa.getText, was getting an empty string instead of the 
      attribute value. Many thanks to Daniel Weber for the report and provided fix.
    * Sarissa now explicitly sets IE's default behavior regarding validateOnParse and  
      ProhibitDTD to false, thanks to matek994 (SF.net username) and 2907778 (SF.net userid) 
    * Sarissa.xmlize now does not try to xmlize functions and can thus handle more
      complex structures without infinite recursion errors thanks to iklotzko (SF.net user)
    * Not sure how far IE can carry this but try to do something useful when ActiveX is disabled
      thanks to alexeev.net
      
0.9.9.4
    * Added first attempt on a MediaWiki API
    * Fixed callback execution in updateContentFromForm and updateContentFromUri
      thanks to javinto (SF user) 
    * Fixed selectNodes bug thanks to Doug Clayton

0.9.9.3
    * XMLHttpRequest is now always defined for IE, even version 7 to avoid version 
      problems between ActiveX controls (IE7 hardcodes XMLHttpRequest to MSXML 3.0).
      Many thanks to reporter Scott Chinn. Special thanks to dougdomeny and 
      Ron MacCracken (rmaccracken) for working on solutions.
    * Fixed the "send results" form unit tests page to work with IE 

0.9.9.2
    * Fixed a variable scope in Sarissa.updateContentFromURI thanks to Lawrence Michel
    * Fixed JSLint and JSDoc reports in build (errr, "somebody" forgot to re-enable them after 
      commenting them out to get a faster build while doing 0.9.9.1 ;-)
    * Applied the new dev.abiss.gr skin properly in the generated docos
    * Made some minor code changed to pass more JSLint errors/warnings

      (SF user) andHartmut Wynen for finding the bug and solution respectively. 
    * Refactored the callback stuff in Sarissa.updateContentFromXXX methods. They work alot
      better and with appropriate signatures now. Sarissa.updateContentFromNode now uses no 
      callbacks since it's not an async method.
    * Added table utilities, just sorting for table data for now. Maybe you'll find it usefull.

0.9.9
    * Fixed errors in Sarissa.updateContentFromForm (that's what you get for 
      not keeping your unit tests up to date)
    * Two distributions now exist: a JAR artifact for for Maven users 
      (sarissa-VERSION.jar) and one for generic projects that also includes the 
      documentation (sarissa-full-VERSION.zip)

    * Optimised XSLTProcessor.importStylesheet for IE; it will now reload a remote

      As i  explained i have been unable to ovecome this re-occuring typo for the last 10  
      years due to my coin-op (video game arcades) addiction as a kid ;-)

0.9.7
    * Special thanks to Abiss.gr for sponsoring my new dev machine. Sarissa now is developed
      on an Apple Quad G5 so Safari, Camino and OS X in general can be properly tested
    * Moved all the .load bloat to sarissa_ieemu_load.js and deprecated it. XMLHttpRequest

    * Fixed bug where window.Node was overwritten in Moz when sarissa was evaluated
      dynamically (talk about extreme usecases) thanks to John Hax

      by JS versions < 1.4, as suggested by troyllama (sourceforge user) 
    * Activex may not be needed in IE7 so progIDs are only initialized on user request, 
      thanks to Yiremyahu (sourceforge user) for pointing out the issue
    * Removed Sarissa.serialize in favor of XMLSerializer and doc.innerHTML for XML and 
      HTML documents respectively. Besides the function was inconsistent, thanks to 
      ######INSERT NAME HERE######## for pointing that out

    * Fixed bug in Sarissa.updateContentFromNode thanks to Franky Braem
    * Added Safari DOMParser support thanks to a wonderfull idea published 
      by Nate Steiner on his blog that utilizes the data: URI scheme and 
      Erik Arvidsson that suggested this could easily be wrapped to emulate 
      DOMParser. Many thanks to cedric for pointing out the above (between other things).
    * Removed XSLTProcessor.tranfrormToFragment (didn't work anyway)
    * Added .load support for Opera thanks to cedric
    * Added support for HTML nodes in Sarissa.serialize 
    * Tried to make Safari sniffing more strict thanks to Phil Green who pointed out spoofing is easy
    * Fixed bugs thanks to feedback by Vincenzo Alcamo

0.9.6
    * Deprecated stuff as warned in 0.9.4 ;-)
    * Big change: loadXML is no longer used, as there's no way to emulate it in Opera.
      So i just removed it directly; to load an XML string to a DOM, you have to use the 
      DOMParser object. No way to do anything like that in Safari though.
    * Added Minesweeper as first sample application, original code kindly donated by
      Sean Whalen, also maintainer of it; welcome Sean!

      for each download ;-)

    * Added Sarissa.xmlize howto 
    * Fixed documentation errors thanks to R. Mark Volkmann
    * Upgraded JSDoc

0.9.5.1 
    * Added Sarissa.escape and Sarissa.unescape, to convert 
      from and to the five predefined XML entities
    * Fixed a bug in Sarissa.xmlize (yup, added escaping ;-)
      
0.9.5
    * Added Sarissa.xmlize which produces XML out of any given 
      ecmascript object and updated JSDoc version/documentation

0.9.4.4 
    * Fixed and deprecated Sarissa.IS_ENABLED_XSLTPROC bug in Moz 
      and added fixcrlf task in build. 

0.9.4.3 
    * Fixed bugs in methods of sarissa_dhtml

0.9.4.2
    * Fixed a bug in transformNode and transformNodeToObject in
      sarissa_ieemu_xslt.js (it was not really working)

0.9.4.1 
    * Fixed a bug in XML loading from URLs and shaped things up a little bit.

0.9.4:
    * NOTE: Deprecated stuff will go away in 0.9.6. You have been warned!
    * Refactored to suport KHTML/Webcore (Konqueror/Safari)

    * the xml property is now deprecated. Use Sarissa.serialize instead

    * Sarissa was "adversely affecting Array". Now, Sarissa uses the  new 
      SarissaNodeList class that inherits Array, instead of extending Array
      directly. Many thanks to Rob (Flaherty?) for the bug report and initial patch.

0.9.xx 
    * No changelog kept, but many thanks go to Axel Hecht, Jonas Sicking, 
      the folks at netscape.public.mozilla.* forums, Dimitre Novatchev, Ken Sall,
