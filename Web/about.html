    <h1>About this Deployment</h1>
    <p>This instance of CrisisTracker tracks public messages posted on Twitter
    in relation to the Syrian Civil War. Its purpose is to increase global
    awareness of the humanitarian situation in Syria.</p>
    <p>The website takes no side
    in the Syrian conflict, and any content bias only reflects the content that
    is pubblished by users of the Twitter microblogging service. Although
    information is pre-filtered before entering this system, the keywords we use
    are mostly neutral, such as place names.</p>

    <h1>About CrisisTracker</h1>

    <p>CrisisTracker is a software platform that extracts situational awareness reports
    from torrents of public tweets during humanitarian disasters. It combines different kinds
    of automated processing with crowdsourcing to quickly detect new events and bring
    together related evidence into stories.</p>

    <p>CrisisTracker is free and open source. Instructions how to set up your own
    instance are available on
    <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/jakobrogstadius/crisistracker">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h2>Distributed Sensing via Social Media</h2>
    <p>During humanitarian crises in recent years, online social media (mainly Twitter,
    Facebook and YouTube) have emerged as a means for affected local populations to
    communicate their experiences to the world. With increasing technology adoption
    and public access to most posted messages, it is now possible to tap into real-time
    reports from thousands or millions of people on the ground.</p>

    <p>The Twitter microblogging service saw 500 million tweets being posted daily in
    October 2012, by over 200 million active users. Unlike for instance Facebook and
    SMS, the vast majority of these tweets is shared publicly and can be accessed in
    real-time though an application programming interface (API). The challenge however
    is sense-making. With so much content being generated, maintaining overview and
    history, and detecting patterns and actionable information, requires specialized
    information management tools. This is what CrisisTracker aims to provide.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>The CrisisTracker platform uses an automated real-time clustering
    algorithm based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to group together tweets that
    are textually very similar. A cluster of messages (a "story") typically refers to
    a single well-defined event, such as artillery shelling of a location, a disease
    outbreak in a refugee camp, a bombing, etc.</p>
    <p>Although individual tweets are both extremely brief (maximum 140 characters) and
    difficult to verify independently, stories in CrisisTracker capture the event
    from multiple angles and provide a real-time index of published evidence in the
    form of images, video and news articles.</p>
    <p>Events during a time period can be summarized by looking at those stories that were
    mentioned by the highest number of Twitter users.</p>

    <h2>AIDR Integration</h2>
    <p><a href="http://aidr.qcri.org/" target="_blank">AIDR</a> - Artificial Intelligence
    for Disaster Response - is an open-source system developed at
    <a href="http://www.qcri.com/" target="_blank">QCRI</a> that provides
    automated real-time topic classification of document streams. It is a supervised
    classifier, meaning that it learns how to classify documents based on examples provided
    by human curators.</p>
    <p>The AIDR platform has been integrated into CrisisTracker to provide the topic filters
    seen on the <a href="explore.html">explore page</a>. You can help teach the system how to better classify content
    by visiting the <a href="train.html">training page</a>.</p>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>CrisisTracker is free and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JakobRogstadius/CrisisTracker">open source</a>,
    so that you can deploy your own instance or integrate it with your own analysis software.
    The developers will be happy to hear from you if you set up a deployment!</p>
